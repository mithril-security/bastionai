# üëã Welcome to BastionLab!

Where data owners and data scientists can securely collaborate without exposing data - opening the way to projects that were too risky to consider. 

## What is BastionLab?

**BastionLab is a data science framework to perform remote and secure Exploratory Data Analysis.**

- Data scientists can **remotely run queries on data frames without seeing the original data or intermediary results**.
- Data owners can let **external or internal data scientists explore and extract values from their datasets, according to the strict privacy policies they defined**.

This wasn‚Äôt possible until now for highly regulated fields like health, finance, or advertising. When collaborating remotely, data owners had to open their whole dataset, often through a Jupyter notebook. This was dangerous because too many operations were allowed and the data scientist had numerous ways to extract information from the remote infrastructure (print the whole database, save the dataset in the weights, etc).

BastionLab solves this problem by ensuring that only privacy-friendly operations are allowed on the data and anonymized outputs are shown to the data scientist. 

**BastionLab is an open-source project.** Our solution is coded in Rust and uses Polars, a pandas-like library for data exploration. You can check [the code on our GitHub](https://github.com/mithril-security/bastionlab/) and our [roadmap](). 

We‚Äôll update the documentation as new features come in, so dive in!
