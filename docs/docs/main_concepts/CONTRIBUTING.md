### I only have a question

### BastionAI Project

**BastionAIüöÄüîí** is a fast, easy-to-use confidential artificial intelligence (AI) platform for training AI models on private data.

With BastionAI, users can:

- Confidently fine-tune a model by sending data to the Cloud without data being exposed in clear.
- Securely train a model on datasets aggregated from multiple data sources, without any party having to show their data to the others.

The solution has two parts:
- A server which uses [tch-rs](), which contains Rust bindings for [libtorch]() Pytorch's C++ backend. It's used training AI models with privacy guarantees (Built with **Rust**).
- A client SDK to securely send datasets, and models to be trained on the server (Built with **Python**).

You can find more information about the **Roadmap** of the project [here](https://blog.mithrilsecurity.io/our-roadmap-at-mithril-security/#bastionai).

### Useful Resources
