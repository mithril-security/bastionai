# Setting up your dev environment

## Using remote container extension on Visual Studio Code üê≥

Clone the Github repository and open it in Visual Studio Code. If you do not have the remote container extension, Visual Studio Code should prompt you to install it. 

Open the green menu at the bottom-left of the Visual Studio Code.

Choose: "Open folder in container". It will build for you the image described in [this Dockerfile](https://github.com/mithril-security/bastionai/blob/master/server/Dockerfile) with the dev-env target. It installs Ubuntu18-04 and all the dependencies and drivers the project needs as well as the Rust analyzer, python-intellisense and jupyter-notebook Visual Studio Code extensions.

To get started on the project you should create a python virtual environment like this :
```
virtualenv ~/python3.9-dev-env
source ~/python3.9-dev-env/bin/activate
```

Then you can install the python client SDK in editable mode with :
```
cd client
python setup.py install
pip install -e .
```

And try to build the server part, by following [this tutorial](../deployment/on_premise.md#by-locally-building-from-source).

## Without Docker

If you don't want to use docker, you will need to install the following:

* LibTorch 
* Rust

You can find the [installation guides](https://pytorch.org/cppdocs/installing.html)
